I have read the CSE departmentâ€™s anti-cheating policy available at https://www.cse.
iitk.ac.in/pages/AntiCheatingPolicy.html. I understand that plagiarism is a severe
offense. I have solved this assignment myself without indulging in any plagiarism.
If my submission is found to be plagiarized from the internet, fellow students, etc.,
then strict action can be taken against me.

Resources:
Lots and lots of stackexchange and stackoverflow to debug the code
man pages of strace and ftrace to get a good understanding of the syscalls

Note:
While testing subpart2 of question1, comment out the check condition for valid memory
(I have explicitly written which lines to comment out in tracer.c )
